"""Bounded ThreadingMixIn — acquire concurrency slot BEFORE spawning a worker.

ThreadingHTTPServer / ThreadingTCPServer spawn a thread in process_request()
before the handler runs. A semaphore taken inside do_GET/do_POST therefore
does not bound thread creation.

Use BoundedThreadingMixIn (or wrap process_request) so the limit is real.
